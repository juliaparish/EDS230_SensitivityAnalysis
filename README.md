### Authors: Group I Paloma Cartwright, Juliet Cohen, Julia Parish

## Assignment: Sensitivity Analysis - Latin Hypercube Sampling

This model was developed as an assignment for a UCSB Bren School Masterâ€™s program course, Environmental Data Science 230: | Environmental Science Management 232: Environmental Modeling. 

Original assignment instructions can be found [here](https://naomitague.github.io/ESM232_course/assignments/assign_LHS.html). 

### Motivation and Goal
This environmental model and analysis was completed as an assignment for the course, Environmental Data Science 230 | Environmental Science & Management: Modeling Environmental Systems. The source data and model design is based on parameters provided from our professor and [here](https://naomitague.github.io/ESM232_course/assignments/assign_LHS.html). This assignment focuses on developing skills to create a atmospheric conductance model function, utilize the Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) to generate near random sample of parameter values, and then plot the atmospheric conductance values.

The **goal** of this assignment was to conduct a formal sensitivity analysis using the Latin Hypercube Sampling random sampling method.
