# Sensitivity Analysis - Latin Hypercube Sampling


This environmental model was completed as an assignment for the course, Environmental Data Science 230 | Environmental Science & Management: Modeling Environmental Systems. The goal of this assignment was to build a model ... and conduct a ... . The source data and model design is based on



## 1. Code a function to compute atmospheric conductance Cat (how easily vapor diffuses from vegetation surfaces)


## 2. 


## 3. Conduct a sensitivity analysis
Consider the sensitivity of your estimate to uncertainty in the following parameters and inputs


## Summary of results
